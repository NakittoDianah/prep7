            Besides video funs i love reading novels of which my best novels
            are <strong> <cite>Twilight saga</cite> and

            <h3>True Story</h3>
            <p style="float:right">In life we are all entitled to prince
                 charmimgs and due this statement, we shouldn't 
                force out things. Love is meant to be smoothly driven as the two
                 lovers in<strong> <cite>Twilight saga</cite> that is Edward and Bella
               </strong> proved this. There fancy love started as a joke and
                at the end it made wondrous changes to Edward's family
               where they gave birth to a more powerful girl child.
               My main emphasis hear is not to fight LOVE but fight for LOVE. Because this two characters 
               fought hard until there love life succeded.
